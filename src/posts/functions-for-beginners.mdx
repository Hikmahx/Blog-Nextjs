Functions are a fundamental concept in programming that allow you to encapsulate a block of code that can be reused. In Python, defining and using functions is straightforward.

### Defining a Function

To define a function in Python, use the `def` keyword followed by the function name and parentheses `()`. You can also specify parameters inside the parentheses if your function needs inputs.

```python
def greet(name):
    """Function to greet a person by name."""
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

### Calling a Function

Once defined, you can call a function by using its name followed by parentheses `()`.

```python
greet("Alice")
```

### Return Statement

Functions can also return values using the `return` statement. This allows functions to compute a result that can be used elsewhere in your code.

```python
def add(a, b):
  """Function to add two numbers."""
  return a + b

result = add(3, 5)
print("The sum is:", result)
```

### Conclusion

Functions are essential for organizing code and promoting reusability in Python. As you learn more, you'll discover their power in creating modular and efficient programs.
